# Windows Key Generator üîê

<sup>By Arnav Thorat, [InfiniTech](https://youtube.com/InfiniTech78)</sup>

This program generates product keys for Windows 95 and above! Please note that for Windows 95 and Office 95, it uses a special formula, which means that the keys it provides are random, but still work. From Windows 98 and onwards, the keys are encrypted and stored in the code.

Please only use these keys for educational purposes only!

_Note: From Windows Vista and onwards, the official Microsoft bypass keys are used. These can be accessed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-server/get-started/kms-client-activation-keys)._

## How to Use

### Installation

**Work in progress! The `.exe` is not ready yet!**

To download the executable, please go to the releases tab and download the latest version. If you have Node.js installed, you can download the `.zip` file, extract the source code, and then run `node .` in the top-level directory of the code where `index.js` is. Please note that `npm` must also be installed.

The display will be the same in both the executable and in Node.js - a terminal prompt!

### Getting Windows 95/Office 95 Keys

To get Windows 95/Office 95 keys, the program uses a formula to calculate the possible Windows 95 keys. Enter in the number which corresponds to Windows 95, as shown below.
